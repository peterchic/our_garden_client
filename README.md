Our Garden

This app aims to address the demand for fresh, local produce. I wanted to create an app where a user can find people within their own community that are willing to sell their extra produce. A user would be able to leave reviews on the specific gardener, purchase produce and contact the seller.
In an age where you can turn small profits by renting your home(Air BnB), utilizing your vehicle(Uber/Lyft), why not provide a platform for your typical gardener to sell his/her surplus yield.

This was created using Rails backend API and a React client side.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
